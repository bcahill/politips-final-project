If I&#39;m president I know what we need to do, there&#39;s no confusion about that. I know what needs to be done. I have been there at all levels. But we came in there, $8 billion in the hole, a loss of 350,000 jobs. One guy said he gave a dollar to double the rainy day fund. A lot of hopelessness here. Particularly among the poor, the minorities. People said maybe Ohio&#39;s best days are behind them. I thought that was baloney.
