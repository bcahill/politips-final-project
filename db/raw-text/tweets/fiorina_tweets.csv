2015-07-28 01:36:52 +0000,Margaret Thatcher once said that she was not content to manage the decline of a great nation. Neither am I. #Carly2016
2015-07-28 01:36:04 +0000,It is the height of hypocrisy for @HillaryClinton to run for President as a champ. of women's rights when her record as SOS is this dismal.
2015-07-28 01:35:45 +0000,"China, Russia, Iran, &amp; terrorist groups such as ISIS – these are the big human rights tests of our time. #Carly2016"
2015-07-28 01:34:58 +0000,"In February 2009, she told us we couldn’t let human rights get in the way of our other goals."
2015-07-28 01:34:44 +0000,".@HillaryClinton likes to talk about her support of human rights, women's rights and democracy. Her actions conflict with her words."

2015-07-28 01:31:15 +0000,We must push back against rising Chinese aggression. We should work w/ Vietnam &amp; the Philippines to improve their surveillance capabilities.
2015-07-28 01:28:27 +0000,China is using their economic might to rewrite the global order. #Carly2016
2015-07-28 01:27:56 +0000,Here is another truth we must see and speak and act upon. China is our rapidly rising adversary. #Carly2016
2015-07-28 01:19:02 +0000,We must have the strongest military on the face of the planet &amp; everyone has to know it. #Carly2016
