2015-02-24 19:43:40 +0000,"I am here today to ask you to do what may be politically difficult, but what is morally the right thing to do."
2015-02-24 19:43:28 +0000,This is the cost of pushing this off to somebody else. There is no one else. There is no one else but us.
2015-02-24 19:43:15 +0000,This is the cost of inaction. This is the cost of doing nothing.
2015-02-24 19:43:05 +0000,…by providing tax relief and new jobs which lead to fulfilling careers.

2014-12-04 20:44:41 +0000,This is a mistake and a missed opportunity.
2014-12-04 20:44:35 +0000,"In the last few years, the leadership of the United States government has not always placed sufficient priority on North America."
2014-12-04 20:43:07 +0000,It is time to get this done.
2014-12-04 20:43:01 +0000,"As I said earlier, a key goal in the U.S.-Canada relationship should be getting stuff done that is in our mutual interest."
2014-12-04 20:42:21 +0000,"and creating jobs, growth and opportunity for all."
2014-12-04 20:42:12 +0000,"And the principles should be enhancing the economic competitiveness of North America, treating allies with respect and fair consideration"
2014-12-04 20:41:26 +0000,"Our leaders’ comments on this topic should not be marked by parochialism, but by principles."
2014-12-04 20:40:56 +0000,"This is not about sending “your oil” across “our land”.  It’s about maximizing the benefits of North America’s natural resources for all,."
2014-12-04 20:40:28 +0000,"Secondly, this is no way to treat a friend."
2014-12-04 20:39:23 +0000,Keystone has now languished for way too long.  And I think this sends a very unfortunate signal.
2014-12-04 20:38:12 +0000,"The State Department’s own environmental impact study concluded that they are safe, and Keystone would be safe."
2014-12-04 20:37:55 +0000,My view is that we are missing an enormous opportunity when we delay its development.
2014-12-04 20:37:42 +0000,"That brings us, of course, to the major debate on the Keystone XL pipeline."
2014-12-04 20:37:29 +0000,"It shouldn't be that controversial.  In the United States, we already have over 2.2 million miles of pipelines."
2014-12-04 20:36:46 +0000,"The North American energy renaissance has made us all better off, from multiple perspectives – economically, strategically, &amp;environmentally"
2014-12-04 20:32:43 +0000,Canada is the United States’ largest and most reliable supplier of energy.
2014-12-04 20:31:27 +0000,In no area are the benefits of adopting that “roll up our sleeves and do the hard work” more clearly significant than in the area of energy.
