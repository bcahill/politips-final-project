 Thank you. My name is Marco Rubio. I'm from Florida. My wife Jeanette and I are the proud -- we've been married 17 years, and we're the proud parents of four children, two of whom were able to join us here this evening.

I'm honored to be here at the Reagan Library, at a place that honors the legacy of a man who inspired not just my interest in public service, but also our love for country.

And I'm also aware that California has a drought, and so that's why I made sure I brought my own water.

(LAUGHTER)

 Well, first of all, I have an understanding of exactly what it is Russia and Putin are doing, and it's pretty straightforward. He wants to reposition Russia, once again, as a geopolitical force.

He himself said that the destruction of the Soviet Union -- the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, and now he's trying to reverse that.

He's trying to destroy NATO. And this is what this is a part of. He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East.

Here's what you're gonna see in the next few weeks: the Russians will begin to fly -- fly combat missions in that region, not just targeting ISIS, but in order to prop up Assad.

He will also, then, turn to other countries in the region and say, "America is no longer a reliable ally, Egypt. America is no longer a reliable ally, Saudi Arabia. Begin to rely on us."

What he is doing is he is trying to replace us as the single most important power broker in the Middle East, and this president is allowing it. That is what is happening in the Middle East. That's what's happening with Russia, and...

 Let me tell you -- I will tell you we have zero responsibility, because let's remember what the president said. He said the attack he would conduct would be a pinprick. Well, the United States military was not build to conduct pinprick attacks.

If the United States military is going to be engaged by a commander-in-chief, it should only be engaged in an endeavor to win. And we're not going to authorize use of force if you're not put in a position where they can win.

And quite frankly, people don't trust this president as commander-in-chief because of that.

(APPLAUSE)

 In the middle of negotiating this treaty, Khamenei led the assembled masses in chanting, death to America. I'm reminded of a great editorial cartoon. It shows the Ayatollah Khamenei saying, "Death to all Americans," and then it shows John Kerry coming back, saying, "Can we meet ya half way?"

(LAUGHTER)

We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up and protect this country. And I'll tell you, I can't wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary, you are voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon and if you elect me as president, under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to America ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.

(CROSSTALK)

 Ms. Dana, I agree that English is the unifying language of our country, and everyone should learn to speak it. It's important.

I want to tell you a story about someone that didn't speak English that well. It was my grandfather; he came to this country in the 1960s, as a -- escaping Cuba. And he lived with us, growing up.

And my grandfather loved America. He understood what was so special about this country. He loved Ronald Reagan; he would be very proud of the fact that we're here this evening.

My grandfather instilled in me the belief that I was blessed to live in the one society in all of human history where even I, the son of a bartender and a maid, could aspire to have anything, and be anything that I was willing to work hard to achieve.

But he taught me that in Spanish, because it was the language he was most comfortable in. And he became a conservative, even though he got his news in Spanish.

And so, I do give interviews in Spanish, and here's why -- because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility.

And if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me. Not from a translator at Univision.

 Well, let me say that legal immigration is not an issue I read about in the newspaper. Immigration, illegal immigration, all the good aspects of immigration and all the negative ones as well, I live with. My family's immigrants. My neighbors are all immigrants. My in-laws are all immigrants.

So I've seen every aspect of it, and I can tell you America doesn't have one immigration problem, it has three.

First, despite the fact that we are the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally.

Second, we have a legal immigration system that no longer works. It primary is built on the basis of whether you have a relative living here instead of merit.

And third, we have 11 million or 12 million people, many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally.

And we must deal with all three of these problems. We cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation. I learned that. We tried it that way.

Here's the way forward: First, we must -- we must secure our border, the physical border, with -- with a wall, absolutely. But we also need to have an entry/exit tracking system. 40 percent of the people who come here illegally come legally, and then they overstay the visa. We also need a mandatory e-verify system.

After we've done that, step two would be to modernize our legal immigration system so you come to America on the basis of what you can contribute economically, not whether or not simply you have a relative living here.

And after we've done those two things, I believe the American people...

 ... will be very reasonable and responsible about what you do with someone who's been here and isn't a criminal. If you're a criminal, obviously, you will not be able to stay.

 Yes, well, it does. But it's in the following way, this is an important question. I think if you're running for president, these are important issues, because look at around the world today.

There is a lunatic in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons and long-range rocket that can already hit the very place in which we stand tonight. The Chinese are rapidly expanding their military. They hack into our computers. They're building artificial islands in the South China Sea, the most important shipping lane in the world.

A gangster in Moscow is not just threatening Europe, he's threatening to destroy and divide NATO. You have radical jihadists in dozens of countries across multiple continents. And they even recruit Americans using social media to try to attack us here at home.

And now we have got this horrible deal with Iran where a radical Shia cleric with an apocalyptic vision of the future is also guaranteed to one day possess nuclear weapons and also a long-range rocket that can hit the United States.

These are extraordinarily dangerous times that we live in. And the next president of the United States better be someone that understands these issues and has good judgment about them because the number one issue that a president will ever confront, and the most important obligation that the federal government has, is to keep this nation safe.

And today we are not doing that. We are eviscerating our military. And we have a president that is more respectful to the ayatollah in Iran than he is to the prime minister of Israel.

(APPLAUSE)

 Well, that's why we have a debate. I think that we should have a deeper debate about these issues, because there is no more important decision that a president will make.

 Well, you should ask him questions in detail about the foreign policy issues our president will confront, because you had better be able to lead our country on the first day.

Not six months from now, not a year from now, on the first day in office, our president could very well confront a national security crisis. You can't predict it. Sometimes you cannot control it.

And it is the most -- the federal government does all kinds of things it's not supposed to be doing. It regulates bathrooms. It regulates schools that belong to local communities.

But the one thing that the federal government must do, the one thing that only the federal government can do is keep us safe. And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office.

(APPLAUSE)

 Trust (ph) me, I get that. OK.

 I never get to addressed, and...

 ...and when I do, I'm gonna jump in.

 Yeah. He did. Let me -- I'm proud to serve in the United States Senate. You know, when I ran five years ago, the entire leadership of my party in Washington lined up against me.

But I'm glad I won. And I'm glad that I ran, because this country's headed in the wrong direction. And if we keep electing the same people, nothing is going to change.

And you're right, I have missed some votes, and I'll tell you why, Mr. Trump. Because in my years in the Senate, I've figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people.

You have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck, and nothing is being done about it. We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in -- in -- in debt, and they're about to raise the debt limit again.

We have a world that grows increasingly dangerous, and we are eviscerating our military spending and signing deals with Iran. And these -- if this thing continues, we are going to be the first Americans to leave our children worse off than ourselves.

That's why I'm missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate, I'm not running for re-election, and I'm running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential, but with the right person in office, the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known.

 I want to go even deeper -- and I want to go even deeper in that direction, because I think the belief that somehow by retreating, America makes the world safer has been disproven every single time it's ever been tried.

Syria's a perfect example of it. The uprising in Syria was not started by the United States; it was started by the Syrian people. And I warned at the time -- this was three and a half years ago -- I openly and repeatedly warned that if we did not find moderate elements on the ground that we could equip and arm, that void would be filled by radical jihadists.

Well, the president didn't listen, the administration didn't follow through, and that's exactly what happened. That is why ISIS grew. That is why ISIS then came over the border from Syria and back into Iraq.

What is happening in that region is the direct consequence of the inability to lead and of disengagement. And the more we disengage, the more airplanes from Moscow you're going to see flying out of Damascus and out of Syria...

 ... as you asked earlier today.

(APPLAUSE)

 But radical terrorism cannot be solved by intellect. It cannot -- they require -- what they need, is they need an operating space. That's what Afghanistan was for Al Qaida. It was a vacuum that they filled, and they created an operating space.

That's why they had to be drawn out of there. That's why they had to be destroyed. It is the reason why ISIS has grown as well. We allowed them -- we allowed a vacuum to emerge in Syria. They used it as an operating space to grow; and today they're not just in Iraq and Syria anymore, they're now in Libya, conducting operations in the Sinai.

They're now in Afghanistan, trying to supplant the Taliban as the most powerful radical jihadist group on the ground there, as well. You cannot allow radical jihadists to have an operating safe haven anywhere in the world.

 There's a broader issue here, Hugh. And there's a broader issue here as well.

First of all, the only people that follow the law are law-abiding people. Criminals by definition ignore the law, so you can pass all the gun laws in the world, like the left wants. The criminals are going to ignore it because they are criminals.

Here's the real issue.

(APPLAUSE)

The real issue -- the real issue is not what are people using to commit violence, but why are they committing the violence? And here's the truth: Because you cannot separate the social, moral wellbeing of your people from their economic and other wellbeing. You cannot separate it.

You can't have a strong country without strong people, you cannot have strong people without strong values, and you cannot have strong values without strong families and the institutions in this country that defend and support those families.

 Well, and today, we have a left-wing government under this president that is undermining all of the institutions and society that support the family and teach those values.

 Because we're not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do. We're not going to...

 Well, and I don't -- he may have lined up with their positions on this issue. But here is the bottom line. Every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America.

Single parents are already struggling across this country to provide for their families. Maybe a billionaire here in California can afford an increase in their utility rates, but a working family in Tampa, Florida, or anywhere across this country cannot afford it.

So we are not going to destroy our economy. We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely.

But America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is. And they're drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get a hold of.

So the bottom line is, I am not in favor of any policies that make America a harder place for people to live, or to work, or to raise their families.

(APPLAUSE)

 Jake, you mentioned me and called me a denier. Let me say, climate change...

 OK. A skeptic. You can measure the climate. You can measure it. That's not the issue we're discussing. Here is what I'm skeptical of. I'm skeptical of the decisions that the left wants us to make, because I know the impact those are going to have and they're all going to be on our economy.

They will not do a thing to lower the rise of the sea. They will not do a thing to cure the drought here in California. But what they will do is they will make America a more expensive place to create jobs.

And today with millions of people watching this broadcast that are struggling paycheck to paycheck that do not know how they're going to pay their bills at the end of this month, I'm not in favor of anything that is going to make it harder for them to raise their family.

(CROSSTALK)

 Senator Rubio, you mean?

 I know we all look alike.

(LAUGHTER)

 The -- Rosa Parks, an everyday American that changed the course of history.

 Well, there are some people in Florida upset at me over a joke I made about Florida State, but, what the heck, I want my codename to be Gator.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

 One of the things that made Ronald Reagan a great president, is that he understood that America was a unique nation, like any other that had existed throughout human history. He knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty, and choose their own path in life. He didn't just believe it, he acted on it. That's why bringing down communism was so important to him. If I'm honored with the opportunity to be president, I hope that our Air Force One will fly, first and foremost, to our allies; in Israel, in South Korea, and Japan. They know we stand with them. That America can be counted on.

It would also fly to China, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there, but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within China. I would even invite them to my inauguration.

We would also fly into Moscow and into Russia. And not just meet with the leaders of Russia, but also meet with those who aspire to freedom and liberty in Russia. And ultimately, I hope that my Air Force One, if I become president, will one day land in a free Cuba, where its people can choose its leaders and its own destiny.

(APPLAUSE)

 Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight. Let me begin by saying this: I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate.

I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.

Here's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.

This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.

If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.

If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future.

(APPLAUSE)

 Let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.

I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of.

And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in. And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally.

(APPLAUSE)

 And so these are important issues, and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.

 Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform. It is critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform. And it should happen at the state and local level. That is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed.

Here's the problem with Common Core. The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate.

In fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states.

(APPLAUSE)

 That's a great question.

 That's a great question.

First of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.

Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling.

The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.

We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.

And last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks.

(APPLAUSE)

20 -- over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the -- since Dodd-Frank has passed. We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank. We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners.

 Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all--

 I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.

In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

 And let me go further. I believe that every single human being is entitled to the protection of our laws, whether they can vote or not. Whether they can speak or not. Whether they can hire a lawyer or not. Whether they have a birth certificate or not. And I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live.

(APPLAUSE)

 Well, first, let me say I think God has blessed us. He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can't even find one.

(LAUGHTER)

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

 And I believe God has blessed our country. This country has been extraordinarily blessed. And we have honored that blessing. And that's why God has continued to bless us.

And he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people.

Unfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them. I am proud that last year we helped change the law. We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn't doing their job.

And it is outrageous they've only fired one person to date. When I'm president of the United States, we're going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

 Thank you. You know, both of my parents were born into poor families on the island of Cuba. They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance. Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could.

My father was a bartender. And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream. It is what makes our nation different. And I'm running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now. I run for president because I believe that we can't just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And that's why I'm asking for your vote. So we can make America greater than it has ever been. And make this century a new American century.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.
After months of deliberation and prayer about the future of our country, I have come here tonight to make an announcement on how I believe I can best serve her.
I chose to make this announcement at the Freedom Tower because it is a symbol of our nation’s identity as the land of opportunity. And I am more confident than ever that despite our troubles, we have it within our power to make our time another American Century.
In this very room five decades ago, tens of thousands of Cuban exiles began their new lives in America. Their story is part of the larger story of the American miracle. How, united by a common faith in their God given right to go as far as their talent and work would take them, a collection of immigrants and exiles, former slaves and refugees, became one people, and together built the freest and most prosperous nation ever.
For almost all of human history, power and wealth belonged only to a select few. Most people who have ever lived were trapped by the circumstances of their birth, destined to live the life their parents had. But America is different. Here, we are the children and grandchildren of people who refused to accept this.
Both of my parents were born to poor families in Cuba. After his mother died when he was nine, my father left school to go work. My mother was one of seven girls raised by a disabled father who struggled to provide for his family.
When they were young, my parents had big dreams for themselves. But because they were not born into wealth or power, their future was destined to be defined by their past. So in 1956 they came here, to the one place on earth where the aspirations of people like them could be more than just dreams.
My father became a bartender. My mother a cashier, a maid and a Kmart stock clerk. They never made it big. But they were successful. Two immigrants with little money or education found stable jobs, owned a home, retired with security and gave all four of their children a life far better than their own.
My parents achieved what came to be known as the American Dream. But now, too many Americans are starting to doubt whether achieving that dream is still possible:
Hard working families living paycheck to paycheck, one unexpected expense away from disaster…
Young Americans, unable to start a career, a business or a family, because they owe thousands in student loans for degrees that did not lead to jobs…
And small business owners, left to struggle under the weight of more taxes, more regulations and more government.
Why is this happening in a country that for over two centuries has been defined by equality of opportunity?
Because while our people and economy are pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, too many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the twentieth century.
They are busy looking backward, so they do not see how jobs and prosperity today depend on our ability to compete in a global economy. So our leaders put us at a disadvantage by taxing, borrowing and regulating like it’s 1999.
They look for solutions in yesterday, so they don’t see that good-paying modern jobs require different skills and more education than the past. They blindly support an outdated higher education system that is too expensive and inaccessible to those who need it most.
And they have forgotten that when America fails to lead, global chaos inevitably follows, so they appease our enemies, betray our allies and weaken our military.
At the turn of the 19th century, a generation of Americans harnessed the power of the Industrial Age and transformed this country into the leading economy in the world. And the 20th century became the American Century.
Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century.
If we reform our tax code, reduce regulations, control spending, modernize our immigration laws and repeal and replace ObamaCare, the American people will create millions of better-paying modern jobs.
If we create a 21st century system of higher education that provides working Americans the chance to acquire the skills they need, that no longer graduates students with mountains of debt and degrees that do not lead to jobs, and that graduates more students from high school ready to work, then our people will be prepared to seize their opportunities in the new economy.
If we remember that family – not government – is the most important institution in society, that all life deserves protection, and that all parents deserve to choose the education that’s right for their children, then we will have a strong people and a strong nation.
And if America accepts the mantle of global leadership, by abandoning this administration’s dangerous concessions to Iran, and its hostility to Israel; by reversing the hollowing out of our military; by giving our men and women in uniform the resources, care and gratitude they deserve; by no longer being passive in the face of Chinese and Russian aggression; and by ending the near total disregard for the erosion of democracy and human rights around the world; then our nation will be safer, the world more stable, and our people more prosperous.
This election is not just about what laws we will pass. It is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be.
Just yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday.
But yesterday is over, and we are never going back. We Americans are proud of our history, but our country has always been about the future. Before us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America.
We can’t do that by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past. We must change the decisions we are making by changing the people who are making them.
That is why today, grounded by the lessons of our history, and inspired by the promise of our future, I announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America.
My candidacy might seem improbable to some watching from abroad. In many countries, the highest office in the land is reserved for the rich and powerful. But I live in an exceptional country where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege.
I recognize the challenges of this campaign, and the demands of the office I seek. But in this endeavor as in all things, I find comfort in the ancient command to, “Be strong and courageous! Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”
I have heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn. But I cannot. Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as President.
I am humbled by the realization that America doesn’t owe me anything; but I have a debt to America I must try to repay. This isn’t just the country where I was born; America is the place that changed my family’s history.
I regret my father did not live to see this day in person. He used to tell me all the time: En este pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos.
“In this country, you will achieve all the things we never could.”
On days when I am tired or discouraged, I remember the sound of his keys jingling at the front door of our home, often well past midnight, as he returned from another long day at work. When I was younger, I didn’t fully appreciate all he did for us, but now as my own children grow older, I fully understand.
My father was grateful for the work he had, but that was not the life he wanted for his children. He wanted all the dreams he once had for himself to come true for us. He wanted all the doors that closed for him to be open for me.
My father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room for all those years, so that tonight I could stand behind this podium in the front of this room.
That journey, from behind that bar to behind this podium, is the essence of the American Dream.
Whether or not we remain a special country will depend on whether that journey is still possible for those trying to make it now:
The single mother who works long hours for little pay so her children don’t have to struggle the way she has…
The student who takes two buses before dawn to attend a better school halfway across town…
The workers in our hotel kitchens, the landscaping crews in our neighborhoods, the late-night janitorial staff that clean our offices … and the bartenders who tonight are standing in the back of a room somewhere…
If their American Dreams become impossible, we will have become just another country. But if they succeed, the 21st Century will be another American Century. This will be the message of my campaign and the purpose of my presidency.
To succeed on this journey, I will need your prayers, your support, and ultimately, your vote. Tonight I am asking you to take that first step with me, by joining us at marcorubio.com.
My wife Jeanette and my four children are here tonight. The next 19 months will take me far from home. I will miss watching Amanda run track, Daniella play volleyball, Anthony play football and Dominick play soccer.
But I have chosen this course because this election is about them. Theirs is the most important generation in American history. If we can capture the promise of this new century they will be the freest and most prosperous Americans ever. But if we fail, they will be the first generation of Americans to inherit a country worse off than the one left for their parents.
The final verdict on our generation will be written by Americans not yet born. Let us make sure they record that we made the right choice. That in the early years of this century, faced with a rapidly changing and uncertain world, our generation rose to face the great challenges of our time.
And because we did, there was still one place in the world where who you come from does not determine how far you can go.
Because we did, the American miracle lived on.
And because we did, our children and theirs lived in a new American Century.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

2015-05-13 20:04:44 +0000,And I believe America will continue to advance the cause of peace and freedom in our time.
2015-05-13 20:04:33 +0000,"I believe mankind remains afflicted, and that its destiny remains in our hands."
2015-05-13 20:04:22 +0000,I believe America still has that genius.
2015-05-13 20:03:49 +0000,Only American leadership will bring safety and enduring peace.
2015-05-13 20:03:20 +0000,"Protecting our people and their interests  ,  is the highest honor, the greatest burden, and the most profound privilege"
2015-05-13 20:02:14 +0000,"But increasingly in recent years, I’ve also met people frustrated by the direction of American leadership."
2015-05-13 20:02:05 +0000,"I have seen American freedom and security play out in the lives of my parents, my children… and myself."
2015-05-13 20:00:17 +0000,It will reestablish a foreign policy based on strategy and principle rather than politics and polls.
2015-05-13 20:00:09 +0000,This approach will restore American leadership to a world badly in need of it.
2015-05-13 20:00:03 +0000,"Those are the 3 pillars of my doctrine - American Strength, the protection of our global economy &amp; proud advocacy for America’s core values"
2015-05-13 19:58:51 +0000,"In this century, we must restore America’s willingness to think big — to state boldly what we stand for and why it is right."
2015-05-13 19:58:06 +0000,America is the first power in history motivated by a desire to expand freedom rather than its own territory.
2015-05-13 19:57:49 +0000,"We must recognize that our nation is a global leader not just because it has superior arms, but because it has superior aims."
2015-05-13 19:57:39 +0000,The third pillar of my doctrine is moral clarity regarding America’s core values.
2015-05-13 19:57:33 +0000,"In this century, businesses must have the freedom to operate around the world with confidence."
2015-05-13 19:56:55 +0000,"I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space."
2015-05-13 19:56:02 +0000,Millions of the best jobs in this century will depend on international trade.
2015-05-13 19:55:56 +0000,"Now, in the 21st century, you can access global markets in a single second, with a tap on your smartphone."
2015-05-13 19:55:34 +0000,The second pillar of my doctrine is the protection of the American economy in a globalized world.
2015-05-13 19:53:34 +0000,"So to restore American Strength, my first priority will be to adequately fund our military."
2015-05-13 19:53:10 +0000,This is an idea that stems from a simple truth: the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest.
2015-05-13 19:53:00 +0000,The first is American Strength.
2015-05-13 19:52:54 +0000,My foreign policy doctrine consists of three pillars.
2015-05-13 19:52:49 +0000,"Today, I intend to offer such a doctrine. And in the coming years, I intend to be such a president."
2015-05-13 19:52:34 +0000,One who will set forth a doctrine for the exercise of American influence in the world.
2015-05-13 19:52:28 +0000,The 21st century requires a president who will answer that question with clarity and consistency.
2015-05-13 19:52:20 +0000,What principles should govern the exercise of our power?
2015-05-13 19:52:12 +0000,The question before us is not “should we lead?” but rather “how should we lead?”
2015-05-13 19:52:03 +0000,"We cannot bring about peace and stability on our own, but the world cannot do it without us."
2015-05-13 19:51:36 +0000,The stakes of tomorrow are too high to look to the failed leadership of yesterday.
2015-05-13 19:51:25 +0000,… a leader from yesterday whose tenure as Secretary of State was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst.
2015-05-13 19:51:16 +0000,We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration’s foreign policy…
2015-05-13 19:51:00 +0000,It is up to our next president to properly fund and modernize our military.
2015-05-13 19:50:55 +0000,It is up to our next president to right the wrongs done by our current one.
2015-05-13 19:50:44 +0000,I believe the onus of maintaining American Strength lies where the buck stops.
2015-05-13 19:50:35 +0000,"When we fail to lead with strength and principle, no other country, friend or foe, is willing or able to take our place."
2015-05-13 19:49:31 +0000,We’ve seen peaceful protestors met with violence from their governments.
2015-05-13 19:49:25 +0000,We’ve seen cyber-attacks against our allies and our own people.
2015-05-13 19:49:21 +0000,We’ve seen North Korea expand its nuclear arsenal and continue its brutal human rights violations.
2015-05-13 19:49:12 +0000,We’ve seen China rapidly expand its military capabilities and take aggressive action in the South and East China Seas.
2015-05-13 19:48:55 +0000,We’ve seen hundreds of thousands of Syrians slaughtered at the whim of a tyrant.
2015-05-13 19:48:41 +0000,"We’ve seen ISIL sweep across multiple states, commit brutal atrocities, and attempt to establish a caliphate."
2015-05-13 19:48:25 +0000,This deterioration of our physical and ideological strength has led to a world far more dangerous than when President Obama entered office.
2015-05-13 19:48:16 +0000,President Obama has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.
2015-05-13 19:48:06 +0000,He criticized America for having “arrogance” and the audacity to “dictate our terms” to other nations.
2015-05-13 19:47:58 +0000,President Obama demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain.
2015-05-13 19:47:41 +0000,He enacted hundreds of billions in defense cuts that left our Army on track to be at pre-World War II levels…
2015-05-13 19:47:17 +0000,"Today, as never before, foreign policy is domestic policy."
2015-05-13 19:47:05 +0000,Turmoil across the world can impact American families almost as much as turmoil across town.
2015-05-13 19:46:55 +0000,The prosperity of our people now depends on their ability to interact freely and safely in the international marketplace.
2015-05-13 19:46:42 +0000,"In recent decades, technology has demolished barriers of travel and trade, transforming our national economy into a global one."
2015-05-13 19:46:35 +0000,"Since the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American Strength has not."
2015-05-13 19:46:25 +0000,"And that weakness, on the other hand, is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace."
2015-05-13 19:46:17 +0000,"American Strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it."
2015-05-13 19:46:01 +0000,… eventually bringing about the conclusion of the Cold War and the emergence of America as the world’s only superpower.
2015-05-13 19:45:53 +0000,"The commitment to American Strength JFK spoke of lived on long after him — across decades, across both parties…"

2015-04-13 22:09:02 +0000,"Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century."
2015-04-13 22:08:31 +0000,"While our people and economy are pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, too many leaders and their ideas are stuck in the 20th century"

2015-04-13 22:06:13 +0000,"But because they were not born into wealth or power, their future was destined to be defined by their past."
2015-04-13 22:05:57 +0000,"When they were young, my parents had big dreams for themselves."
2015-04-13 22:05:36 +0000,"Here, we are the children and grandchildren of people who refused to accept this."
2015-04-13 22:05:14 +0000,"Most people who have ever lived were trapped by circumstances of birth, destined to live the life their parents had. America is different."
2015-04-13 22:04:12 +0000,"I am more confident than ever that despite our troubles, we have it within our power to make our time another American Century"

2014-02-03 00:45:21 +0000,The Broncos struggles all a direct result of Namath jumping gun and tossing coin before Ref was ready.
2014-02-03 00:43:07 +0000,He was down
2014-02-03 00:42:16 +0000,Only way to slowdown that pass rush is a running game. Something Broncos can't do now down by 22. That pass rush created two interceptions
2014-02-03 00:40:07 +0000,This is turning into one of those 80s SuperBowls. All blowouts
2014-02-03 00:38:57 +0000,Disaster. That middle pressure on QB is always a killer
2014-02-03 00:37:26 +0000,I can't see the coverage from TV. But need to attack that seam in middle
2014-02-03 00:35:36 +0000,I think they can get 80 ball the way they are playing him
2014-02-03 00:34:24 +0000,Look for 80 now Peyton
2014-02-03 00:33:49 +0000,That was a great route by Welker. Using outside leverage awesome!
2014-02-03 00:31:43 +0000,He had the first and almost lost it
2014-02-03 00:23:12 +0000,That works too.
2014-02-03 00:22:50 +0000,It's there. They are coming hard at Lynch. Play action!!
2014-02-03 00:22:11 +0000,Play action now!!
2014-02-03 00:21:48 +0000,"Rollout, good throw, PI in endzone. First and goal from 1."
2014-02-03 00:21:14 +0000,Play action or roll Russell out
2014-02-03 00:20:26 +0000,I think Seahawks can get play action TD here
2014-02-03 00:19:45 +0000,See. Came back with motion then inside give to Lynch. A little looser
2014-02-03 00:17:12 +0000,That edge run by Harvin now run twice trying to get Broncos to get OLB a little wider to open inside the tackles for Lynch.
2014-02-03 00:15:21 +0000,Chancellor is first quarter MVP so far.
2014-02-03 00:14:42 +0000,Good job #RadioShack on 80s commercial
2014-02-03 00:13:35 +0000,That was a pressure int. notice how forced manning to throw off back foot not set and ball sailed. Guy was open
2014-02-03 00:10:53 +0000,Broncos need to test this secondary downfield. Need to see how the refs are going to call the secondary play.
2014-02-03 00:08:05 +0000,Quick read middle to 15 on a LB. Right decision. Good play by D.
2014-02-03 00:05:48 +0000,Unless you get a quick read down middle go endzone corner for either a great catch or a PI. If not you take the 3 and are up 8-0.
2014-02-03 00:03:31 +0000,Go endzone with throw
2014-02-03 00:01:17 +0000,Yep. 89 bad matchup for Bailey. Out and up
2014-02-03 00:00:30 +0000,Seahawks need to keep attacking perimeter and crossing action from slot. Look for 15 again or 89
2014-02-02 23:56:54 +0000,See that? Throws really well when moving. Design that
2014-02-02 23:56:11 +0000,It's early but Wilson struggling with throws outside numbers. I think they need to roll him out a little. Does well on move.
2014-02-02 23:47:57 +0000,Right challenge by #Seahawks a first half time out not as valuable as second half timeout.
2014-02-02 23:46:08 +0000,Not sure how you call that short. Nose of ball hit the yard mark which was line to gain.
2014-02-02 23:43:38 +0000,That was a first down. Will probably have to measure from new spot but put it down on yard mark from back angle
2014-02-02 23:36:19 +0000,Didn't count on a safety. Revised pick: Denver 24-23.

Thank You!!"
 Thank you. My name is Marco Rubio. I'm from Florida. My wife Jeanette and I are the proud -- we've been married 17 years, and we're the proud parents of four children, two of whom were able to join us here this evening.

I'm honored to be here at the Reagan Library, at a place that honors the legacy of a man who inspired not just my interest in public service, but also our love for country.

And I'm also aware that California has a drought, and so that's why I made sure I brought my own water.

(LAUGHTER)

 Well, first of all, I have an understanding of exactly what it is Russia and Putin are doing, and it's pretty straightforward. He wants to reposition Russia, once again, as a geopolitical force.

He himself said that the destruction of the Soviet Union -- the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, and now he's trying to reverse that.

He's trying to destroy NATO. And this is what this is a part of. He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East.

Here's what you're gonna see in the next few weeks: the Russians will begin to fly -- fly combat missions in that region, not just targeting ISIS, but in order to prop up Assad.

He will also, then, turn to other countries in the region and say, "America is no longer a reliable ally, Egypt. America is no longer a reliable ally, Saudi Arabia. Begin to rely on us."

What he is doing is he is trying to replace us as the single most important power broker in the Middle East, and this president is allowing it. That is what is happening in the Middle East. That's what's happening with Russia, and...

 Let me tell you -- I will tell you we have zero responsibility, because let's remember what the president said. He said the attack he would conduct would be a pinprick. Well, the United States military was not build to conduct pinprick attacks.

If the United States military is going to be engaged by a commander-in-chief, it should only be engaged in an endeavor to win. And we're not going to authorize use of force if you're not put in a position where they can win.

And quite frankly, people don't trust this president as commander-in-chief because of that.

(APPLAUSE)

 In the middle of negotiating this treaty, Khamenei led the assembled masses in chanting, death to America. I'm reminded of a great editorial cartoon. It shows the Ayatollah Khamenei saying, "Death to all Americans," and then it shows John Kerry coming back, saying, "Can we meet ya half way?"

(LAUGHTER)

We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up and protect this country. And I'll tell you, I can't wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary, you are voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon and if you elect me as president, under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to America ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.

(CROSSTALK)

 Ms. Dana, I agree that English is the unifying language of our country, and everyone should learn to speak it. It's important.

I want to tell you a story about someone that didn't speak English that well. It was my grandfather; he came to this country in the 1960s, as a -- escaping Cuba. And he lived with us, growing up.

And my grandfather loved America. He understood what was so special about this country. He loved Ronald Reagan; he would be very proud of the fact that we're here this evening.

My grandfather instilled in me the belief that I was blessed to live in the one society in all of human history where even I, the son of a bartender and a maid, could aspire to have anything, and be anything that I was willing to work hard to achieve.

But he taught me that in Spanish, because it was the language he was most comfortable in. And he became a conservative, even though he got his news in Spanish.

And so, I do give interviews in Spanish, and here's why -- because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility.

And if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me. Not from a translator at Univision.

 Well, let me say that legal immigration is not an issue I read about in the newspaper. Immigration, illegal immigration, all the good aspects of immigration and all the negative ones as well, I live with. My family's immigrants. My neighbors are all immigrants. My in-laws are all immigrants.

So I've seen every aspect of it, and I can tell you America doesn't have one immigration problem, it has three.

First, despite the fact that we are the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally.

Second, we have a legal immigration system that no longer works. It primary is built on the basis of whether you have a relative living here instead of merit.

And third, we have 11 million or 12 million people, many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally.

And we must deal with all three of these problems. We cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation. I learned that. We tried it that way.

Here's the way forward: First, we must -- we must secure our border, the physical border, with -- with a wall, absolutely. But we also need to have an entry/exit tracking system. 40 percent of the people who come here illegally come legally, and then they overstay the visa. We also need a mandatory e-verify system.

After we've done that, step two would be to modernize our legal immigration system so you come to America on the basis of what you can contribute economically, not whether or not simply you have a relative living here.

And after we've done those two things, I believe the American people...

 ... will be very reasonable and responsible about what you do with someone who's been here and isn't a criminal. If you're a criminal, obviously, you will not be able to stay.

 Yes, well, it does. But it's in the following way, this is an important question. I think if you're running for president, these are important issues, because look at around the world today.

There is a lunatic in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons and long-range rocket that can already hit the very place in which we stand tonight. The Chinese are rapidly expanding their military. They hack into our computers. They're building artificial islands in the South China Sea, the most important shipping lane in the world.

A gangster in Moscow is not just threatening Europe, he's threatening to destroy and divide NATO. You have radical jihadists in dozens of countries across multiple continents. And they even recruit Americans using social media to try to attack us here at home.

And now we have got this horrible deal with Iran where a radical Shia cleric with an apocalyptic vision of the future is also guaranteed to one day possess nuclear weapons and also a long-range rocket that can hit the United States.

These are extraordinarily dangerous times that we live in. And the next president of the United States better be someone that understands these issues and has good judgment about them because the number one issue that a president will ever confront, and the most important obligation that the federal government has, is to keep this nation safe.

And today we are not doing that. We are eviscerating our military. And we have a president that is more respectful to the ayatollah in Iran than he is to the prime minister of Israel.

(APPLAUSE)

 Well, that's why we have a debate. I think that we should have a deeper debate about these issues, because there is no more important decision that a president will make.

 Well, you should ask him questions in detail about the foreign policy issues our president will confront, because you had better be able to lead our country on the first day.

Not six months from now, not a year from now, on the first day in office, our president could very well confront a national security crisis. You can't predict it. Sometimes you cannot control it.

And it is the most -- the federal government does all kinds of things it's not supposed to be doing. It regulates bathrooms. It regulates schools that belong to local communities.

But the one thing that the federal government must do, the one thing that only the federal government can do is keep us safe. And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office.

(APPLAUSE)

 Trust (ph) me, I get that. OK.

 I never get to addressed, and...

 ...and when I do, I'm gonna jump in.

 Yeah. He did. Let me -- I'm proud to serve in the United States Senate. You know, when I ran five years ago, the entire leadership of my party in Washington lined up against me.

But I'm glad I won. And I'm glad that I ran, because this country's headed in the wrong direction. And if we keep electing the same people, nothing is going to change.

And you're right, I have missed some votes, and I'll tell you why, Mr. Trump. Because in my years in the Senate, I've figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people.

You have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck, and nothing is being done about it. We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in -- in -- in debt, and they're about to raise the debt limit again.

We have a world that grows increasingly dangerous, and we are eviscerating our military spending and signing deals with Iran. And these -- if this thing continues, we are going to be the first Americans to leave our children worse off than ourselves.

That's why I'm missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate, I'm not running for re-election, and I'm running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential, but with the right person in office, the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known.

 I want to go even deeper -- and I want to go even deeper in that direction, because I think the belief that somehow by retreating, America makes the world safer has been disproven every single time it's ever been tried.

Syria's a perfect example of it. The uprising in Syria was not started by the United States; it was started by the Syrian people. And I warned at the time -- this was three and a half years ago -- I openly and repeatedly warned that if we did not find moderate elements on the ground that we could equip and arm, that void would be filled by radical jihadists.

Well, the president didn't listen, the administration didn't follow through, and that's exactly what happened. That is why ISIS grew. That is why ISIS then came over the border from Syria and back into Iraq.

What is happening in that region is the direct consequence of the inability to lead and of disengagement. And the more we disengage, the more airplanes from Moscow you're going to see flying out of Damascus and out of Syria...

 ... as you asked earlier today.

(APPLAUSE)

 But radical terrorism cannot be solved by intellect. It cannot -- they require -- what they need, is they need an operating space. That's what Afghanistan was for Al Qaida. It was a vacuum that they filled, and they created an operating space.

That's why they had to be drawn out of there. That's why they had to be destroyed. It is the reason why ISIS has grown as well. We allowed them -- we allowed a vacuum to emerge in Syria. They used it as an operating space to grow; and today they're not just in Iraq and Syria anymore, they're now in Libya, conducting operations in the Sinai.

They're now in Afghanistan, trying to supplant the Taliban as the most powerful radical jihadist group on the ground there, as well. You cannot allow radical jihadists to have an operating safe haven anywhere in the world.

 There's a broader issue here, Hugh. And there's a broader issue here as well.

First of all, the only people that follow the law are law-abiding people. Criminals by definition ignore the law, so you can pass all the gun laws in the world, like the left wants. The criminals are going to ignore it because they are criminals.

Here's the real issue.

(APPLAUSE)

The real issue -- the real issue is not what are people using to commit violence, but why are they committing the violence? And here's the truth: Because you cannot separate the social, moral wellbeing of your people from their economic and other wellbeing. You cannot separate it.

You can't have a strong country without strong people, you cannot have strong people without strong values, and you cannot have strong values without strong families and the institutions in this country that defend and support those families.

 Well, and today, we have a left-wing government under this president that is undermining all of the institutions and society that support the family and teach those values.

 Because we're not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do. We're not going to...

 Well, and I don't -- he may have lined up with their positions on this issue. But here is the bottom line. Every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America.

Single parents are already struggling across this country to provide for their families. Maybe a billionaire here in California can afford an increase in their utility rates, but a working family in Tampa, Florida, or anywhere across this country cannot afford it.

So we are not going to destroy our economy. We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely.

But America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is. And they're drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get a hold of.

So the bottom line is, I am not in favor of any policies that make America a harder place for people to live, or to work, or to raise their families.

(APPLAUSE)

 Jake, you mentioned me and called me a denier. Let me say, climate change...

 OK. A skeptic. You can measure the climate. You can measure it. That's not the issue we're discussing. Here is what I'm skeptical of. I'm skeptical of the decisions that the left wants us to make, because I know the impact those are going to have and they're all going to be on our economy.

They will not do a thing to lower the rise of the sea. They will not do a thing to cure the drought here in California. But what they will do is they will make America a more expensive place to create jobs.

And today with millions of people watching this broadcast that are struggling paycheck to paycheck that do not know how they're going to pay their bills at the end of this month, I'm not in favor of anything that is going to make it harder for them to raise their family.

(CROSSTALK)

 Senator Rubio, you mean?

 I know we all look alike.

(LAUGHTER)

 The -- Rosa Parks, an everyday American that changed the course of history.

 Well, there are some people in Florida upset at me over a joke I made about Florida State, but, what the heck, I want my codename to be Gator.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

 One of the things that made Ronald Reagan a great president, is that he understood that America was a unique nation, like any other that had existed throughout human history. He knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty, and choose their own path in life. He didn't just believe it, he acted on it. That's why bringing down communism was so important to him. If I'm honored with the opportunity to be president, I hope that our Air Force One will fly, first and foremost, to our allies; in Israel, in South Korea, and Japan. They know we stand with them. That America can be counted on.

It would also fly to China, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there, but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within China. I would even invite them to my inauguration.

We would also fly into Moscow and into Russia. And not just meet with the leaders of Russia, but also meet with those who aspire to freedom and liberty in Russia. And ultimately, I hope that my Air Force One, if I become president, will one day land in a free Cuba, where its people can choose its leaders and its own destiny.

(APPLAUSE)

 Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight. Let me begin by saying this: I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate.

I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.

Here's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.

This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.

If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.

If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future.

(APPLAUSE)

 Let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.

I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of.

And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in. And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally.

(APPLAUSE)

 And so these are important issues, and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.

 Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform. It is critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform. And it should happen at the state and local level. That is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed.

Here's the problem with Common Core. The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate.

In fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states.

(APPLAUSE)

 That's a great question.

 That's a great question.

First of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.

Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling.

The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.

We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.

And last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks.

(APPLAUSE)

20 -- over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the -- since Dodd-Frank has passed. We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank. We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners.

 Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all--

 I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.

In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

 And let me go further. I believe that every single human being is entitled to the protection of our laws, whether they can vote or not. Whether they can speak or not. Whether they can hire a lawyer or not. Whether they have a birth certificate or not. And I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live.

(APPLAUSE)

 Well, first, let me say I think God has blessed us. He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can't even find one.

(LAUGHTER)

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

 And I believe God has blessed our country. This country has been extraordinarily blessed. And we have honored that blessing. And that's why God has continued to bless us.

And he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people.

Unfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them. I am proud that last year we helped change the law. We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn't doing their job.

And it is outrageous they've only fired one person to date. When I'm president of the United States, we're going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

 Thank you. You know, both of my parents were born into poor families on the island of Cuba. They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance. Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could.

My father was a bartender. And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream. It is what makes our nation different. And I'm running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now. I run for president because I believe that we can't just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And that's why I'm asking for your vote. So we can make America greater than it has ever been. And make this century a new American century.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.
After months of deliberation and prayer about the future of our country, I have come here tonight to make an announcement on how I believe I can best serve her.
I chose to make this announcement at the Freedom Tower because it is a symbol of our nation’s identity as the land of opportunity. And I am more confident than ever that despite our troubles, we have it within our power to make our time another American Century.
In this very room five decades ago, tens of thousands of Cuban exiles began their new lives in America. Their story is part of the larger story of the American miracle. How, united by a common faith in their God given right to go as far as their talent and work would take them, a collection of immigrants and exiles, former slaves and refugees, became one people, and together built the freest and most prosperous nation ever.
For almost all of human history, power and wealth belonged only to a select few. Most people who have ever lived were trapped by the circumstances of their birth, destined to live the life their parents had. But America is different. Here, we are the children and grandchildren of people who refused to accept this.
Both of my parents were born to poor families in Cuba. After his mother died when he was nine, my father left school to go work. My mother was one of seven girls raised by a disabled father who struggled to provide for his family.
When they were young, my parents had big dreams for themselves. But because they were not born into wealth or power, their future was destined to be defined by their past. So in 1956 they came here, to the one place on earth where the aspirations of people like them could be more than just dreams.
My father became a bartender. My mother a cashier, a maid and a Kmart stock clerk. They never made it big. But they were successful. Two immigrants with little money or education found stable jobs, owned a home, retired with security and gave all four of their children a life far better than their own.
My parents achieved what came to be known as the American Dream. But now, too many Americans are starting to doubt whether achieving that dream is still possible:
Hard working families living paycheck to paycheck, one unexpected expense away from disaster…
Young Americans, unable to start a career, a business or a family, because they owe thousands in student loans for degrees that did not lead to jobs…
And small business owners, left to struggle under the weight of more taxes, more regulations and more government.
Why is this happening in a country that for over two centuries has been defined by equality of opportunity?
Because while our people and economy are pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, too many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the twentieth century.
They are busy looking backward, so they do not see how jobs and prosperity today depend on our ability to compete in a global economy. So our leaders put us at a disadvantage by taxing, borrowing and regulating like it’s 1999.
They look for solutions in yesterday, so they don’t see that good-paying modern jobs require different skills and more education than the past. They blindly support an outdated higher education system that is too expensive and inaccessible to those who need it most.
And they have forgotten that when America fails to lead, global chaos inevitably follows, so they appease our enemies, betray our allies and weaken our military.
At the turn of the 19th century, a generation of Americans harnessed the power of the Industrial Age and transformed this country into the leading economy in the world. And the 20th century became the American Century.
Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century.
If we reform our tax code, reduce regulations, control spending, modernize our immigration laws and repeal and replace ObamaCare, the American people will create millions of better-paying modern jobs.
If we create a 21st century system of higher education that provides working Americans the chance to acquire the skills they need, that no longer graduates students with mountains of debt and degrees that do not lead to jobs, and that graduates more students from high school ready to work, then our people will be prepared to seize their opportunities in the new economy.
If we remember that family – not government – is the most important institution in society, that all life deserves protection, and that all parents deserve to choose the education that’s right for their children, then we will have a strong people and a strong nation.
And if America accepts the mantle of global leadership, by abandoning this administration’s dangerous concessions to Iran, and its hostility to Israel; by reversing the hollowing out of our military; by giving our men and women in uniform the resources, care and gratitude they deserve; by no longer being passive in the face of Chinese and Russian aggression; and by ending the near total disregard for the erosion of democracy and human rights around the world; then our nation will be safer, the world more stable, and our people more prosperous.
This election is not just about what laws we will pass. It is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be.
Just yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday.
But yesterday is over, and we are never going back. We Americans are proud of our history, but our country has always been about the future. Before us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America.
We can’t do that by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past. We must change the decisions we are making by changing the people who are making them.
That is why today, grounded by the lessons of our history, and inspired by the promise of our future, I announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America.
My candidacy might seem improbable to some watching from abroad. In many countries, the highest office in the land is reserved for the rich and powerful. But I live in an exceptional country where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege.
I recognize the challenges of this campaign, and the demands of the office I seek. But in this endeavor as in all things, I find comfort in the ancient command to, “Be strong and courageous! Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”
I have heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn. But I cannot. Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as President.
I am humbled by the realization that America doesn’t owe me anything; but I have a debt to America I must try to repay. This isn’t just the country where I was born; America is the place that changed my family’s history.
I regret my father did not live to see this day in person. He used to tell me all the time: En este pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos.
“In this country, you will achieve all the things we never could.”
On days when I am tired or discouraged, I remember the sound of his keys jingling at the front door of our home, often well past midnight, as he returned from another long day at work. When I was younger, I didn’t fully appreciate all he did for us, but now as my own children grow older, I fully understand.
My father was grateful for the work he had, but that was not the life he wanted for his children. He wanted all the dreams he once had for himself to come true for us. He wanted all the doors that closed for him to be open for me.
My father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room for all those years, so that tonight I could stand behind this podium in the front of this room.
That journey, from behind that bar to behind this podium, is the essence of the American Dream.
Whether or not we remain a special country will depend on whether that journey is still possible for those trying to make it now:
The single mother who works long hours for little pay so her children don’t have to struggle the way she has…
The student who takes two buses before dawn to attend a better school halfway across town…
The workers in our hotel kitchens, the landscaping crews in our neighborhoods, the late-night janitorial staff that clean our offices … and the bartenders who tonight are standing in the back of a room somewhere…
If their American Dreams become impossible, we will have become just another country. But if they succeed, the 21st Century will be another American Century. This will be the message of my campaign and the purpose of my presidency.
To succeed on this journey, I will need your prayers, your support, and ultimately, your vote. Tonight I am asking you to take that first step with me, by joining us at marcorubio.com.
My wife Jeanette and my four children are here tonight. The next 19 months will take me far from home. I will miss watching Amanda run track, Daniella play volleyball, Anthony play football and Dominick play soccer.
But I have chosen this course because this election is about them. Theirs is the most important generation in American history. If we can capture the promise of this new century they will be the freest and most prosperous Americans ever. But if we fail, they will be the first generation of Americans to inherit a country worse off than the one left for their parents.
The final verdict on our generation will be written by Americans not yet born. Let us make sure they record that we made the right choice. That in the early years of this century, faced with a rapidly changing and uncertain world, our generation rose to face the great challenges of our time.
And because we did, there was still one place in the world where who you come from does not determine how far you can go.
Because we did, the American miracle lived on.
And because we did, our children and theirs lived in a new American Century.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

2015-05-13 20:04:44 +0000,And I believe America will continue to advance the cause of peace and freedom in our time.
2015-05-13 20:04:33 +0000,"I believe mankind remains afflicted, and that its destiny remains in our hands."
2015-05-13 20:04:22 +0000,I believe America still has that genius.
2015-05-13 20:03:49 +0000,Only American leadership will bring safety and enduring peace.
2015-05-13 20:03:20 +0000,"Protecting our people and their interests  ,  is the highest honor, the greatest burden, and the most profound privilege"
2015-05-13 20:02:14 +0000,"But increasingly in recent years, I’ve also met people frustrated by the direction of American leadership."
2015-05-13 20:02:05 +0000,"I have seen American freedom and security play out in the lives of my parents, my children… and myself."
2015-05-13 20:00:17 +0000,It will reestablish a foreign policy based on strategy and principle rather than politics and polls.
2015-05-13 20:00:09 +0000,This approach will restore American leadership to a world badly in need of it.
2015-05-13 20:00:03 +0000,"Those are the 3 pillars of my doctrine - American Strength, the protection of our global economy &amp; proud advocacy for America’s core values"
2015-05-13 19:58:51 +0000,"In this century, we must restore America’s willingness to think big — to state boldly what we stand for and why it is right."
2015-05-13 19:58:06 +0000,America is the first power in history motivated by a desire to expand freedom rather than its own territory.
2015-05-13 19:57:49 +0000,"We must recognize that our nation is a global leader not just because it has superior arms, but because it has superior aims."
2015-05-13 19:57:39 +0000,The third pillar of my doctrine is moral clarity regarding America’s core values.
2015-05-13 19:57:33 +0000,"In this century, businesses must have the freedom to operate around the world with confidence."
2015-05-13 19:56:55 +0000,"I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space."
2015-05-13 19:56:02 +0000,Millions of the best jobs in this century will depend on international trade.
2015-05-13 19:55:56 +0000,"Now, in the 21st century, you can access global markets in a single second, with a tap on your smartphone."
2015-05-13 19:55:34 +0000,The second pillar of my doctrine is the protection of the American economy in a globalized world.
2015-05-13 19:53:34 +0000,"So to restore American Strength, my first priority will be to adequately fund our military."
2015-05-13 19:53:10 +0000,This is an idea that stems from a simple truth: the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest.
2015-05-13 19:53:00 +0000,The first is American Strength.
2015-05-13 19:52:54 +0000,My foreign policy doctrine consists of three pillars.
2015-05-13 19:52:49 +0000,"Today, I intend to offer such a doctrine. And in the coming years, I intend to be such a president."
2015-05-13 19:52:34 +0000,One who will set forth a doctrine for the exercise of American influence in the world.
2015-05-13 19:52:28 +0000,The 21st century requires a president who will answer that question with clarity and consistency.
2015-05-13 19:52:20 +0000,What principles should govern the exercise of our power?
2015-05-13 19:52:12 +0000,The question before us is not “should we lead?” but rather “how should we lead?”
2015-05-13 19:52:03 +0000,"We cannot bring about peace and stability on our own, but the world cannot do it without us."
2015-05-13 19:51:36 +0000,The stakes of tomorrow are too high to look to the failed leadership of yesterday.
2015-05-13 19:51:25 +0000,… a leader from yesterday whose tenure as Secretary of State was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst.
2015-05-13 19:51:16 +0000,We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration’s foreign policy…
2015-05-13 19:51:00 +0000,It is up to our next president to properly fund and modernize our military.
2015-05-13 19:50:55 +0000,It is up to our next president to right the wrongs done by our current one.
2015-05-13 19:50:44 +0000,I believe the onus of maintaining American Strength lies where the buck stops.
2015-05-13 19:50:35 +0000,"When we fail to lead with strength and principle, no other country, friend or foe, is willing or able to take our place."
2015-05-13 19:49:31 +0000,We’ve seen peaceful protestors met with violence from their governments.
2015-05-13 19:49:25 +0000,We’ve seen cyber-attacks against our allies and our own people.
2015-05-13 19:49:21 +0000,We’ve seen North Korea expand its nuclear arsenal and continue its brutal human rights violations.
2015-05-13 19:49:12 +0000,We’ve seen China rapidly expand its military capabilities and take aggressive action in the South and East China Seas.
2015-05-13 19:48:55 +0000,We’ve seen hundreds of thousands of Syrians slaughtered at the whim of a tyrant.
2015-05-13 19:48:41 +0000,"We’ve seen ISIL sweep across multiple states, commit brutal atrocities, and attempt to establish a caliphate."
2015-05-13 19:48:25 +0000,This deterioration of our physical and ideological strength has led to a world far more dangerous than when President Obama entered office.
2015-05-13 19:48:16 +0000,President Obama has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.
2015-05-13 19:48:06 +0000,He criticized America for having “arrogance” and the audacity to “dictate our terms” to other nations.
2015-05-13 19:47:58 +0000,President Obama demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain.
2015-05-13 19:47:41 +0000,He enacted hundreds of billions in defense cuts that left our Army on track to be at pre-World War II levels…
2015-05-13 19:47:17 +0000,"Today, as never before, foreign policy is domestic policy."
2015-05-13 19:47:05 +0000,Turmoil across the world can impact American families almost as much as turmoil across town.
2015-05-13 19:46:55 +0000,The prosperity of our people now depends on their ability to interact freely and safely in the international marketplace.
2015-05-13 19:46:42 +0000,"In recent decades, technology has demolished barriers of travel and trade, transforming our national economy into a global one."
2015-05-13 19:46:35 +0000,"Since the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American Strength has not."
2015-05-13 19:46:25 +0000,"And that weakness, on the other hand, is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace."
2015-05-13 19:46:17 +0000,"American Strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it."
2015-05-13 19:46:01 +0000,… eventually bringing about the conclusion of the Cold War and the emergence of America as the world’s only superpower.
2015-05-13 19:45:53 +0000,"The commitment to American Strength JFK spoke of lived on long after him — across decades, across both parties…"

2014-02-03 00:45:21 +0000,The Broncos struggles all a direct result of Namath jumping gun and tossing coin before Ref was ready.
2014-02-03 00:43:07 +0000,He was down
2014-02-03 00:42:16 +0000,Only way to slowdown that pass rush is a running game. Something Broncos can't do now down by 22. That pass rush created two interceptions
2014-02-03 00:40:07 +0000,This is turning into one of those 80s SuperBowls. All blowouts
2014-02-03 00:38:57 +0000,Disaster. That middle pressure on QB is always a killer
2014-02-03 00:37:26 +0000,I can't see the coverage from TV. But need to attack that seam in middle
2014-02-03 00:35:36 +0000,I think they can get 80 ball the way they are playing him
2014-02-03 00:34:24 +0000,Look for 80 now Peyton
2014-02-03 00:33:49 +0000,That was a great route by Welker. Using outside leverage awesome!
2014-02-03 00:31:43 +0000,He had the first and almost lost it
2014-02-03 00:23:12 +0000,That works too.

2014-02-03 00:19:45 +0000,See. Came back with motion then inside give to Lynch. A little looser
2014-02-03 00:17:12 +0000,That edge run by Harvin now run twice trying to get Broncos to get OLB a little wider to open inside the tackles for Lynch.
2014-02-03 00:15:21 +0000,Chancellor is first quarter MVP so far.
2014-02-03 00:14:42 +0000,Good job #RadioShack on 80s commercial
2014-02-03 00:13:35 +0000,That was a pressure int. notice how forced manning to throw off back foot not set and ball sailed. Guy was open
2014-02-03 00:10:53 +0000,Broncos need to test this secondary downfield. Need to see how the refs are going to call the secondary play.
2014-02-03 00:08:05 +0000,Quick read middle to 15 on a LB. Right decision. Good play by D.
2014-02-03 00:05:48 +0000,Unless you get a quick read down middle go endzone corner for either a great catch or a PI. If not you take the 3 and are up 8-0.
2014-02-03 00:03:31 +0000,Go endzone with throw
2014-02-03 00:01:17 +0000,Yep. 89 bad matchup for Bailey. Out and up
2014-02-03 00:00:30 +0000,Seahawks need to keep attacking perimeter and crossing action from slot. Look for 15 again or 89
2014-02-02 23:56:54 +0000,See that? Throws really well when moving. Design that
2014-02-02 23:56:11 +0000,It's early but Wilson struggling with throws outside numbers. I think they need to roll him out a little. Does well on move.
2014-02-02 23:47:57 +0000,Right challenge by #Seahawks a first half time out not as valuable as second half timeout.
2014-02-02 23:46:08 +0000,Not sure how you call that short. Nose of ball hit the yard mark which was line to gain.
2014-02-02 23:43:38 +0000,That was a first down. Will probably have to measure from new spot but put it down on yard mark from back angle
