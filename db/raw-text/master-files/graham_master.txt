Good morning. Thank you for coming.
Many of you have known me for a long time. Some of you have known me since my family lived in the back of the bar in that building. But I’m pretty sure no one here, including me, ever expected to hear me say:
I’m Lindsey Graham, and I’m running for President of the United States of America.
It’s because of you that I can make that statement.
Everything I am, and everything I will be, I owe to the kindness and generosity and example of people in Central and Clemson and Seneca and Walhalla and other towns and farms of upstate South Carolina. Thank you . . . for everything.
I want to be president to protect our nation that we all love so much from all threats foreign and domestic.
So get ready. I know I’m ready.
I want to be president to defeat the enemies trying to kill us, not just penalize them or criticize them or contain them, but defeat them.
Ronald Reagan’s policy of “peace through strength” kept America safe during the Cold War. But we will never enjoy peaceful co-existence with radical Islam because its followers are committed to destroying us and our way of life. However, America can have “Security through Strength.”
I want to be president to meet our problems head on. Honestly and realistically, for the purpose of solving them, not hiding them or taking political advantage of them.
I want to be president to make government work for you, not the other way around.
I want to make government keep its promises to you, to support your dreams, embrace your values, reflect your character.
I want to be president to help us build a future greater than our amazing past. And I’ll work with anyone to do it.
We’ve made some dangerous mistakes in recent years. The Obama Administration, and some of my colleagues in Congress, substituted wishful thinking for sound national security strategy. Every day the headlines attest to the failures of the Obama/Clinton policies.
Simply put, radical Islam is running wild.
They have more safe havens, more money, more weapons and more capability to strike our homeland than anytime since 9/11.
They are large, rich and entrenched.
As president I will make them small, poor and on the run.
I’m afraid some Americans have grown tired of fighting them. I have bad news to share with you — the radical Islamists are not tired of fighting you.
In partnership with others, we must take the fight to them, building lines of defenses over there so they can’t come here. Building up and supporting regional forces to go after their safe havens that could be used to attack our homeland.
The world is exploding in terror and violence but the biggest threat of all is the nuclear ambitions of the radical Islamists who control Iran.
If the United States isn’t firm in our intention to deny them such weapons, Iran will trigger a nuclear arms race in the least stable region on earth, and make it more likely that people who aspire to genocide will have the most effective means to commit it.
Our close ally, Israel, is at risk as a result of Obama’s failed leadership. We share values, we share democracy, and our friendship is unbreakable. To our friends in Israel, I will never abandon you. I will always stand firm in supporting the one and only Jewish state.
I too say – never again.
I am running for president because I have the experience, judgment and will to deny the most radical regimes the most dangerous weapons.
But to defeat this enemy, it will require more than military might.
The most powerful weapon in our arsenal isn’t a gun. It’s an idea. The terrorists are selling a glorious death. We must sell a hopeful life.
I’ve learned from my travels that a small schoolhouse in a remote region educating a young girl can do more damage to radical Islam than any weapon we possess.
Radical Islam is not the only threat we face, old adversaries are seizing new opportunities to challenge our interests. Putin seized Ukrainian territory, and threatens our NATO allies.
China is building – literally building – their own islands in resource rich waters claimed by other nations and challenging free navigation of the seas.
Our allies feel the absence of America’s leadership. Our adversaries are taking advantage. American weakness anywhere hurts us everywhere.
Our enemies are emboldened and our friends are going it alone. Both reactions are detrimental to our interests.
The next President must be an informed and decisive Commander-in-Chief, ready immediately to address these threats.
We’ve learned over the past six years that speeches alone won’t make us safer. Superior power and resolve will.
I’m running for President because I am ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one.
I’m ready on day one to defend our nation with sound strategy, a strong military, stable alliances, and steady determination.
I’ve been to the Middle East more times than I can count, both in my capacity as a U.S. Senator and as a reserve officer in the United States Air Force.
I have more experience with our national security than any other candidate.
I know the players – our friends and our enemies alike. Most importantly, they know me.
I have listened, learned and prepared myself for the job of Commander-in-Chief.
I served in the Air Force for thirty-three years. I spent much of my adult life as part of a team committed to defending America.
Politicians focus on elections. The military focuses on the mission.
If given the privilege to serve as your President, I’ll focus on the mission – to defend America, protect our way of life, and leave the next generation a stronger, safer, better nation than we inherited.
That won’t be easy. It never has been.
There are dangers that must be faced, and as usual, the best of us will have to face the worst of them.
The best of us are the one-percent of Americans who are the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.
I cannot promise as Commander-in-Chief that the dangers they confront, the risks they run, the sacrifices they make will be fewer or easier.
But I can assure them they will have the leadership to defeat our enemies. I can promise them their sacrifices won’t be wasted. They won’t fight with their hands tied behind their backs.
We will end this conflict on our terms. We will win.
Those who believe we can disengage from the world at large and stay safe by leading from behind, vote for someone else. I’m not your man.
Those who believe the best way to defend ourselves is to lead the world, to make history rather than be overwhelmed by it, I ask for your support.
Join me if you want to tackle problems at home that have been kicked down the road because they’re too hard to fix and too easy to demagogue.
Washington’s failure to do the hard but right thing has put Social Security and Medicare in serious jeopardy. As my generation retires both programs are on track to go bust. We’re living longer and fewer workers are supporting more retirees. That’s unsustainable. Everybody knows it. Not everybody admits it.
We have to fix entitlement programs to make sure people who need the benefits the most receive them. That’s going to require determined presidential leadership.
I know from personal experience how important those programs are to the lives of millions of Americans. I lost my parents when I was a young man and my sister was in middle school. We depended on Social Security benefits to survive.
I’ve been fortunate. I’ve done better than I’ve ever dreamed. If I and others like me have to take a little less and pay a little more to help those who need it the most, so be it. And, younger workers might have to work a little longer.
As President, I’ll gladly do what it takes to save a program that once helped my family.
To those who yearn for a safe and healthy environment, I will join your cause. To those who seek energy independence, I will be your champion.
I’m tired of sending hundreds of billions of dollars to buy oil from people who hate us. We must have energy independence. And in the process, I believe it is possible to produce a safe, clean environment, and create new well-paying jobs for Americans of all generations.
To my fellow Republicans, I’ll be a champion for limited and effective government and a strong national defense. I’ll be a voice for social conservative values without apology or animosity. I love my party. I’m committed to see it prosper and grow.
To my friends in the other party, on the big things we share a common fate. I’ll work with you to strengthen the country we both love. Our differences are real, and we’ll debate them. But you’re not my enemy. You’re my fellow countrymen.
My enemies are those who despise our shared values, the enemies of enlightenment, the culture of death that seeks to destroy the dignity of life. We’ll fight them together with our partners. And we’ll win.
To Americans who trust neither party, I will seek the political common ground our nation so desperately needs to find.
That’s what I’ve done before. Don’t take my word for it. Examine my record.
I intend to be president not of a single party, but of a nation. I want to do more than make big government smaller. I want to help make a great nation greater.
I’ve traveled the world, and had experiences and opportunities that I never dreamed of. I’ve been lucky so much of my life, but never luckier than in the people and place I come from.
Those of you who’ve known me a long time know I had some ups and downs as a young man. I lost my parents, and had to struggle financially and emotionally. I would not have made it through those times without you, and without the example my parents set for me.
There are a lot of so-called “self-made” people in this world. I’m not one of them. My family, friends, neighbors and my faith picked me up when I was down, believed in me when I had doubts. You made me the man I am today.
I’m a man with many debts to my family, to you, to South Carolina and to the country. I’m running for president to repay those debts, to fight as hard for you as you fought for me. In the end, that’s the only promise I can make and the only pledge I’ll sign, the only one that matters.
If you make me president, I’ll fight each day harder than I fought the day before to keep this country safe, prosperous and as good as the people who made it great. I humbly ask for your support and your vote. I will work everyday to make you proud.
Thank you, and God bless.

2015-09-08 17:29:42 +0000,I look forward to the debate as to whether or not we should fund IAEA until we get a chance to see the side agreement. #NPCLIVE
2015-09-08 17:29:03 +0000,To deny discussion on this deal would be one of the low points in history of US Senate. #NPCLIVE
2015-09-08 17:28:50 +0000,President Obama can't get this deal. He has neither the will nor an understanding of the complexities of the Middle East. But I do #NPCLIVE
2015-09-08 17:21:53 +0000,Obama says there’s no better deal to be had. Not from a POTUS who negotiates from weakness. But right POTUS will get right deal. #NPCLIVE
2015-09-08 17:21:46 +0000,I am leading the effort to impose additional sanctions on the Iranian regime.  I will also block funding for the IAEA. #NPCLIVE
2015-09-08 17:21:37 +0000,"What did Iran get from the negotiation?  A deal that gives them nuclear bomb, missile to deliver it, &amp; money to pay for it. #NPCLIVE"
2015-09-08 17:21:29 +0000,"In short, Iran set the entire Middle East on fire. #NPCLIVE"
2015-09-08 17:21:15 +0000,"While Obama was backing down from every negotiating objective he had laid out, Iran was taking down the government of Yemen.  #NPCLIVE"
2015-09-08 17:21:06 +0000,"While the Obama Administration was giving away our ability to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, Iran giving rise to ISIL. #NPCLIVE"
2015-09-08 17:20:58 +0000,"While Kerry was giving away the farm at the negotiating table, his State Dept was detailing Iran's terror campaign in Mideast.  #NPCLIVE"
2015-09-08 17:20:48 +0000,We had a president who projected weakness and clearly didn’t understand who he was dealing with. #NPCLIVE
2015-09-08 17:20:41 +0000,I helped lead this effort because I believe that the single greatest threat to our nat'l security is prospect of a nuclear Iran.  #NPCLIVE
2015-09-08 17:16:12 +0000,President Obama chose to remain on the sidelines.  The religious Nazis running Iran faced no consequences for their actions.  #NPCLIVE
2015-09-08 17:15:57 +0000,"Losers of deal include American businesses &amp; officials cyber attacked by China, people of Ukraine, Syrians who suffer under Assad. #NPCLIVE"
2015-09-08 17:15:44 +0000,"When history is written, I believe it will say that President Obama was a weak opponent of evil &amp; poor champion of freedom. #NPCLIVE"
2015-09-08 17:09:22 +0000,"To my Democratic colleagues who say this agreement saves Israel and secures its future, I couldn’t disagree more strongly. #NPCLIVE"
2015-09-08 17:09:07 +0000,President Obama’s deal with Iran could only be reached through a long series of mistakes and miscalculations.  #NPCLIVE

2013-10-28 15:15:39 +0000,We now know #Benghazi was the result of a pre-planned terrorist attack by high-level al-Qaeda operatives. It was never a protest of a video.

2013-10-17 00:17:52 +0000,Today’s agreement is far from great news but brings to an end - at least temporarily - a disaster.
2013-10-17 00:13:49 +0000,"We could have done much, much better. Unfortunately, given where we now find ourselves, this agreement was the best Sen. McConnell could do."
2013-10-16 22:02:52 +0000,"We could have done much, much better. ....By the time we got to this point, we were playing poker only holding a pair of twos."

2013-10-07 17:18:07 +0000,I believe the most responsible course of action would be to hold al-Libi as an enemy combatant at Gitmo for intelligence gathering purposes.
2013-10-07 17:16:04 +0000,Al-Libi is likely to be a treasure trove of valuable intelligence information.

2013-08-19 16:35:59 +0000,"Finally, it’s been almost a year since the attack on our consulate in #Benghazi and no one has been brought to justice. Simply unacceptable."
2013-08-19 16:34:05 +0000,"If captured, Gadahn should NOT be read his Miranda rights but held as an enemy combatant under the Law of War for intelligence gathering."
2013-08-19 16:31:52 +0000,The use of lethal force against American-citizen Al-Qaeda leader Adam Gadahn is appropriate and should be utilized without hesitation.
2013-08-19 16:28:39 +0000,"Even though Adam Gadahn is an American citizen, he should BE subject to being killed or captured by our military and intelligence forces."
2013-08-19 16:24:45 +0000,"Adam Gadahn is an American citizen who has aligned himself with Al-Qaeda. He should be considered an enemy combatant, not a common criminal."

2013-08-15 22:31:08 +0000,President Obama and former Secretary Clinton need to answer for what happened in #Benghazi. We deserve the truth and a full accounting.
2013-08-15 22:18:34 +0000,Illegal immigrants are being paid under the table &amp; that's not fair to American workers. They should have to pay taxes &amp; file tax returns.

2012-10-17 02:42:57 +0000,"Bottom line, Romney did a great job tonight of reminding people of the failed Obama policies over the past 4 years."
2012-10-17 02:36:02 +0000,"Finally, someone running for President who will call China out for cheating. Unlike Obama, Romney will sign my China currency legislation!"
2012-10-17 02:30:31 +0000,Go Mitt Go! I have been fighting this fight for 8 years to label China a currency manipulator.
2012-10-17 02:25:46 +0000,The person who asked the question on Libya is probably surprised to learn that on Day 1 President Obama called it a terrorist attack.
2012-10-17 02:18:09 +0000,Pres Obama only took responsibility for Benghazi attack because everything else they tried hasn't worked.
2012-10-17 01:59:05 +0000,Great job by Governor Romney of reminding people of the reality last 4 years. The Obama record is an albatross around the Presidents neck.
2012-10-17 01:57:01 +0000,That was a weak attempt by President Obama to convince people that Obama economics are working.
2012-10-17 01:42:56 +0000,"Interesting to hear President Obama talk about 'fixing' the economy. Doesn't he deserve blame for breaking it? (Obamacare, stimulus, etc.)"
2012-10-17 01:25:57 +0000,Did I just hear the President say the sign of a strong economy is high gas prices?

2012-10-12 02:10:15 +0000,Paul Ryan understands we will leave Afghanistan based on sound military advice not political/electoral time tables.

2012-10-04 02:31:49 +0000,A great job by Mitt ex imagining how we are on the wrong path and must change course.
2012-10-04 02:28:58 +0000,The President had an opportunity to work with the GOP. Instead in the first two years he ran us over.
2012-10-04 02:26:36 +0000,Most troubling fact after 4 years of Obama economics is young people are really struggling - very high unemployment.
2012-10-04 02:18:53 +0000,Even @MSNBC will have a difficult time spinning tonight's debate as a win for President Obama.
2012-10-04 02:16:58 +0000,President Obama's vision of how to run the government is clearly not working.
2012-10-04 02:15:41 +0000,"After 4 years of running the federal government, President Obama has made government bigger and private sector stagnant."
2012-10-04 02:08:57 +0000,One of the best examples tonight in the differences in philosophy -- private sector health care versus government run.
2012-10-04 02:00:23 +0000,Governor Romney just gave a damming indictment of Obama's  signature issue --Obamacare.
2012-10-04 01:58:13 +0000,"They promised if Obamacare passed HC  premiums would go down. Reality is premiums have gone up by $2,500."
2012-10-04 01:55:57 +0000,"After 4 years of Obama, big banks are still too big to fail and small banks/credit unions are struggling to survive because of Dodd-Frank."
2012-10-04 01:51:33 +0000,Reality is Medicare is going bankrupt without change. Doing nothing ends Medicare for all.
2012-10-04 01:47:05 +0000,President Obama's policies are speeding up the bankruptcy of Medicare. Cutting $700 billion to pay for Obamacare was a poor choice.
2012-10-04 01:41:56 +0000,Tonight may be Governor Romney's best debate performance of Campaign 2012.
2012-10-04 01:40:05 +0000,"If this was a boxing match, they would stop it."

2012-10-04 01:34:23 +0000,Pres Obama has yet to receive 1 vote from a Member of Congress for his budget proposals - a stunning record which may never be matched.
2012-10-04 01:31:04 +0000,"Talking about job creation job is a tough topic for the President. However, talking about the deficit/debt is a nightmare."
2012-10-04 01:28:44 +0000,In his first 2 years Democrats controlled Congress. The stimulus was a miserable failure. It has NOT CREATED jobs.
2012-10-04 01:26:35 +0000,"Its amazing the incumbent, within the first 25 minutes of the debate, cannot say how his policy choices have made things better."
2012-10-04 01:24:28 +0000,Its clear President Obama cannot talk about the last 4 years with any confidence or pride.
2012-10-04 01:22:43 +0000,During Obama's first term spending has gone though the roof. Obama economics have added over $5 trillion to the national debt.
2012-10-04 01:20:31 +0000,A prepared and confident Mitt Romney tonight. He just schooled President Obama on the economy and the Romney tax plan.
2012-10-04 01:15:55 +0000,Nice answer Governor Romney. The first home run of the night. His answer was a great explanation of President Obama's failures.
2012-10-04 01:12:19 +0000,President Obama is 0-2. Two questions and not once has he mentioned a policy choice he made to create jobs.
2012-10-04 01:09:22 +0000,After 4 years of Obama economics we have less people in the workplace. Over 44 months of unemployment at over 8%.
2012-10-04 01:07:44 +0000,Its telling that President Obama cannot detail what he has done to create jobs for the American people.
2012-10-04 01:06:01 +0000,"If this election turns on job creation, we win!"
2012-10-04 01:04:06 +0000,"Tonight is not about the 47%or the 1%, its about the future. Its about can we preserve the American Dream."
